# 🏗️ Forklift Sales Forecasting with AI

This project uses time series forecasting methods to predict future forklift sales using realistic sales data.
## 📁 Files
- `forklift_sales.csv` — Simulated sales data including model, region, quantity, and price
- `forklift_sales_forecasting_notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook that preprocesses, visualizes, and forecasts future sales
## 📈 Model
The project uses:
- Exponential Smoothing (statsmodels)
- Pandas time-series tools
- Matplotlib for visualization
## 🚀 Try It Yourself
You can open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) by uploading the files there.
## 💡 Future Improvements
- Use ARIMA or Prophet for advanced forecasting
- Incorporate external data like seasonality or marketing campaigns
